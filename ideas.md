  **Design Movement**: Modern Organic Minimalism
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Nature-First**: The design should feel like an extension of the outdoors, using organic shapes and textures.
  2. **Clarity & Trust**: Clean lines and ample whitespace to convey professionalism and reliability.
  3. **Local Connection**: Visuals and copy that strongly anchor the business in Western Melbourne.
  4. **Tactile Quality**: Use of textures (grain, paper) to evoke the feeling of soil, stone, and grass.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Forest Green (#2E5945)**: Represents established growth, stability, and nature. Deep and serious to convey expertise.
  - **Charcoal/Blue-Gray (#374151)**: Provides a strong, modern contrast, grounding the green and adding a technical/architectural feel.
  - **Warm Beige/Sand (#F5F5F0)**: A neutral background that warms up the design, avoiding the sterility of pure white.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Asymmetric Balance**: Avoid rigid center alignment. Use offset grids to create dynamic flow, mimicking natural landscapes.
  - **Overlapping Elements**: Images and text boxes slightly overlapping to create depth and connection.
  - **Full-Width Imagery**: Hero sections and dividers that span the full width to immerse the user.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Organic Curve Dividers**: SVG dividers that mimic rolling hills or garden bed edges.
  - **Subtle Texture Overlays**: A faint noise or paper texture on background sections to add tactile quality.
  - **Botanical Line Art**: Minimalist line drawings of plants as background accents or icons.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth Reveal**: Elements fade and slide in gently as the user scrolls, like a garden revealing itself.
  - **Hover Growth**: Buttons and cards slightly scale up or lift (shadow increase) on hover, simulating growth.

  **Animation**:
  - **Parallax Scrolling**: Subtle parallax on background images to create depth.
  - **Staggered Entry**: Text and images enter in a staggered sequence to guide the eye.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Playfair Display** (Serif) - Adds a touch of elegance and established authority.
  - **Body**: **Roboto** or **Open Sans** (Sans-Serif) - Clean, legible, and modern for easy reading of service details.

  **Design Movement**: Industrial Eco-Modernism
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Structure & Order**: Emphasizing the "construction" aspect of landscaping with strong grids and geometric shapes.
  2. **High Contrast**: Bold use of dark and light to create impact and readability.
  3. **Functionality**: A UI that feels like a precision tool – easy to navigate, direct, and efficient.
  4. **Materiality**: Visuals that suggest raw materials like stone, timber, and steel.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Deep Forest Green (#1A3C34)**: Darker, almost black-green for a premium, heavy-duty feel.
  - **Slate Grey (#64748B)**: Represents stone and paving, a core service.
  - **Safety Orange/Gold (#F59E0B)**: Small accent pops for CTAs, inspired by construction safety gear but refined.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: A strict, visible grid layout that showcases services and projects like a portfolio or blueprint.
  - **Split Screen**: Vertical split layouts for comparing "Before & After" or text vs. image.
  - **Card-Based UI**: Services and testimonials contained in distinct, structured cards.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: Heavy borders on images and buttons to suggest durability.
  - **Technical Icons**: Line-style icons that look like architectural blueprints.
  - **Geometric Patterns**: Subtle hexagonal or triangular patterns in backgrounds.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Snap & Click**: Interactions feel mechanical and precise. Instant color changes rather than fades.
  - **Sticky Elements**: Navigation and CTAs that lock into place, reinforcing stability.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slide & Lock**: Elements slide in quickly and stop abruptly, like a latch locking.
  - **ProgressBar**: Scroll progress indicators to show how much content is left.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Oswald** or **Barlow Condensed** (Sans-Serif) - Tall, strong, and industrial.
  - **Body**: **Lato** (Sans-Serif) - Friendly but professional and highly legible.

  **Design Movement**: Lush Garden Editorial
  
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Visual Storytelling**: Treating the website like a high-end gardening magazine.
  2. **Immersive Imagery**: Large, high-quality photos take center stage.
  3. **Softness & Flow**: Avoiding harsh lines in favor of rounded corners and fluid transitions.
  4. **Lifestyle Focus**: Selling the *lifestyle* of a beautiful garden, not just the service.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Sage Green (#84A98C)**: Softer, more approachable green that feels fresh and calming.
  - **Charcoal (#2F3E46)**: For text and high-contrast elements.
  - **Cream/Off-White (#FEFAE0)**: A soft, warm background that is easy on the eyes.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Magazine Layout**: Varied text column widths, pull quotes, and large hero images.
  - **Whitespace Heavy**: Generous margins to let the images breathe.
  - **Centered Focus**: Key messages and CTAs centered for dramatic effect (used sparingly).

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Watercolor Accents**: Soft watercolor washes behind text or as section dividers.
  - **Serif Italic Accents**: Using italicized serif fonts for emphasis or subheadings.
  - **Rounded Frames**: Images with soft, rounded corners or oval masks.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Gentle Fade**: Everything transitions slowly and smoothly.
  - **Parallax Images**: Background images move slower than foreground content.

  **Animation**:
  - **Slow Zoom**: Hero images slowly zoom in to draw the viewer into the scene.
  - **Fade Up**: Text fades up from the bottom as it enters the viewport.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headlines**: **Merriweather** (Serif) - Readable, traditional, and warm.
  - **Body**: **Source Sans Pro** (Sans-Serif) - Neutral and easy to read at small sizes.
